    Question: "Structured Literacy depends on progress monitoring assessments. Yet, can schools do too much?",
    questionP2: "Which of these is appropriate for a 5th frade, all-student, beginning of year (BOY) assessment?",
    answer_type: "mc",
    option1: "Oral Reading Fluency (ORF), i.e. DIBELS or Acadience",
    option2: "i-Ready Diagnostic for Reading",
    option3: "Running Records",
    option4: "A comprehensive spelling assessment like Words Their Way",
    option5: "None of the above",
    option6: "",
    correctAnswer: 4,
    explanation: "Efficiency matters. Most of the time, if end-of-year assessments were given, no additional data will come in 5th grade if the first three were given end of 4th.",
    explanation2: "However, these tests often provide insufficient information of student's spelling or vocabulary.",
